1. Write a Java program in ```FactorialUsingFor.java``` to calculate the factorial of a given positive number using a ```for``` loop.

2. Write a Java program in ```FactorialUsingWhile.java``` to calculate the factorial of a given positive number using a ```while``` loop.

3. Write a Java program in ```FactorialUsingDoWhile.java``` to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer using a ```do...while``` loop.

4. You calculated factorials using ```for```, ```while```, and ```do...while``` loops, now, approach the same problem with a recursive function and compare calculation time to ```for```, ```while```, and ```do...while``` loops.
- Recursive Implementation: Define a recursive function ```factorial``` in ```FactorialComparison.java``` that takes an integer ```n``` as input and returns its factorial.
- Base Case: The base case should handle the factorial of ```0```, which is ```1```.
- Recursive Case: The recursive case should calculate the factorial of ```n``` by multiplying ```n``` with the factorial of ```(n-1)```.
- Performance Comparison: Compare the execution time of the recursive implementation with iterative approaches (e.g., using ```for```, ```while```, and ```do...while``` loops) for different input values. Analyze the time complexity of both approaches.
